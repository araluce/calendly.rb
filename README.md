# Calendly API Rubygem

Easy and comprehensive rubygem for [Calendly](https://calendly.com/). Currently supports [API v2](https://calendly.stoplight.io/docs/api-docs).

You just need a Personal Access Token.

## Dependencies

No dependencies :tada:

We understand the importance of not adding unwanted dependencies.

### Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'calendlyr', '0.7.3'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install calendlyr

### Usage

To access the API, you'll need to create a `Calendlyr::Client` and provide your token. You can generate your Personal Access Token at [https://calendly.com/integrations/api_webhooks](https://calendly.com/integrations/api_webhooks)

```ruby
client = Calendlyr::Client.new(token: ENV["CALENDLY_TOKEN"])
```

The client then provides access to all of the resources.

### Resources

The gem is designed to closely mirror the Calendly API, making it easy to convert API examples into gem code

Responses are created as objects, like `Calendlyr::Event`. Having types like `Calendlyr::User` is useful for understanding the type of object you're working with. These objects are built using `OpenStruct`, allowing you to access data in a Ruby-like way.
