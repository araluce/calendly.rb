# Calendly API Rubygem

Easy and complete rubygem for [Calendly](https://calendly.com/). Currently supports [API v2](https://calendly.stoplight.io/docs/api-docs).

Just needed a Personal Access Token.

## Dependencies

No dependencies :tada:

We know about the importance of not add dependencies that you don't want.

### Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'calendlyr'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install calendlyr

### Usage

To access the API, you'll need to create a `Calendlyr::Client` and pass in your token. You can generate your Personal Access Token at [https://calendly.com/integrations/api_webhooks](https://calendly.com/integrations/api_webhooks)

```ruby
client = Calendlyr::Client.new(token: ENV["CALENDLY_TOKEN"])
```

The client then gives you access to each of the resources.


### Resources

The gem maps as closely as we can to the Calendly API so you can easily convert API examples to gem code.

Responses are created as objects like `Calendlyr::Event`. Having types like `Calendlyr::User` is handy for understanding what type of object you're working with. They're built using OpenStruct so you can easily access data in a Ruby-ish way.
